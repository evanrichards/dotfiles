# Self-Improvement

Review this conversation and identify learnings that would help someone (including future Claude) in a similar situation.

Look for:
- Implementation patterns that weren't obvious from the code
- Debugging insights and troubleshooting steps that worked
- Platform behaviors that required explanation
- "Aha moments" where something clicked after investigation

For each insight:
1. Identify which domain's README it belongs to
2. Summarize the learning concisely
3. Ask if we should add it (don't draft unilaterally)

Focus on confirmed learnings - things we verified actually work and moved the problem forward. Skip speculative ideas or things we tried that didn't pan out.

If no clear learnings emerged, say so - not every session produces README-worthy insights.
