Create a Linear ticket for the AI Platform team.

If $ARGUMENTS is provided: Create the ticket immediately with the provided description.
If $ARGUMENTS is empty: Brainstorm and refine the ticket details with the user before creating it in Linear.

Context:
- User: Evan Richards (evan@loop.com, ID: e88a31ed-fffc-46ea-8c89-f004af4e87a7)
- Team: AI Platform (ID: aac63dd9-6c68-452d-b699-71e3341023ec)

Remember that Linear tickets are standalone documents without chat context. Only include relevant details in the ticket, not the entire brainstorming discussion.

When referencing code in the ticket, include relevant GitHub links when possible.
